Your project must satisfy the following requirements..

  1. Be built using **Express**, **Handlebars**, and **Mongoose**.
     > *You may request to use an alternative to Handlebars. Contact your squad leader for more information.*
  2. **Have at least 1 non-User model**
  3. **Have _complete_ CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes.**
     > You may ***logically*** distribute CRUD functionality across models. This is only permissable when it does not make sense in the context of your application to have full CRUD on one model.
  - **Have its own repository under your GitHub account** (do not fork this repo).
  - **Deploy your application on Heroku**.
  - Have ***validated***, **semantically-clean HTML and CSS**.

Review the [Rubric](evaluation.md) for the specifics of how your project will be graded.

## Deliverables

Your project is due on **Thursday, Jan 11th at 2:00pm**. Create an issue on [the project2-gallery repository](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2-gallery) containing...

  * a link to your Project 2 Github repository
    > *Please do **not** fork this repo*
  * a link to your [screencast presentation](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/project2/blob/master/presentations.md)

Your repo should contain...

  * A **working full-stack application, built by you**, that meets the technical requirements above.
  * **Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning** of the project.
  * **A ``readme.md`` file** in the root of your repo, with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
  * **A `planning` directory** in the root of your repo containing a diagram mapping out your project domain. You are welcome to include other planning documents (e.g., wireframes, user stories).
  * A **link to your hosted, working application** in the URL section of your Github repo.
