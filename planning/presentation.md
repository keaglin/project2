# Presentations

You will prepare a short screencast (3-5 minutes) demonstrating your project, which you will upload to YouTube/Vimeo. We'll watch the presentations together!

### Warnings

- **Do not put your video in your Github repository** or e-mail it to us, since it'll be at least 500MB.
- **Record a quick test video first.** Otherwise you'll end up with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCukspxmNDs).
- **Make sure your microphone is turned on.** See previous comment.

### Hard Requirements

Your video must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo or a similar service. **Please do not e-mail us your video or put it in a Github repository** since it will probably be at least 500MB.

If you have a Gmail account, you already have a YouTube account. Just go to https://www.youtube.com/dashboard.

**Your video must include...**

- ...your voice loud enough to be heard. Speak loudly and clearly when recording!
- ...a description and demo of your app
- ...a code sample explaining one thing you're proud of
- ...one thing you would do differently next time
- ...the next feature you would like to implement

### Submission Deadline: Thursday, November 30th<sup>th</sup>, 12:00pm


## Recording a Video

You may use any video-recording mechanism you wish. Whichever you choose, we recommend that you **make a quick test video first**.

Include a link to your video as an issue on [the Project2-Gallery repository](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2-gallery).

### QuickTime

QuickTime Player is in the Applications folder of your Mac. Notice that if you go to the "File" menu you can create a "New Screen Recording"! This collects audio as well; it's how instructors screencast lessons. You can then save your video to your computer and upload it to YouTube.

**Make sure you turn on the microphone before recording.**

### iMovie

If you're feeling really fancy you can use iMovie -- also in your Applications folder -- to swankify your video. However, this should be a priority far below actually completing your project. Having a snazzy-looking video isn't on the rubric!
